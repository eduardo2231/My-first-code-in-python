# My-first-code-in-python
# Hello!! I want to share my first code in python. I'm very happy because I had never programmed before . It may not seem like much, but it means a lot to me.

It's a simple code that finds lines starting with "From:" extracts those lines and counts them all.





Sou Br e estou estudando inglês a umas 2 semanas, então pode ter uns erros de gramática inglesa. ❤
